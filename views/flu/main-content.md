## How to treat flu yourself

To help you get better more quickly you can:

- rest and sleep
- keep warm
- take paracetamol or ibuprofen to lower your temperature and treat aches and pains
- drink plenty of water to [avoid dehydration](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/dehydration/Pages/Introduction.aspx) (your pee should be light yellow or clear)

## Your pharmacist can help with flu 

Your pharmacist can give treatment advice and recommend flu remedies. 

Be careful not to use them if you’re taking paracetamol and ibuprofen tablets as it’s easy to take more than the recommended dose. 

Speak to your pharmacist before giving medicines to children.

  ## See a GP if: 

  - your symptoms don’t improve after 7 days

  - you’re concerned about your child’s symptoms 
  - you're 65 or over

  ## Call 999 or go to A&E if you: 
  - develop chest pain
  - have shortness of breath 
  - have difficulty breathing  
  - start coughing up blood

## How to avoid spreading the flu 

Flu is very infectious and easily spread to other people. You’re more likely to give it to others in the first 5 days.

Flu is spread by germs from coughs and sneezes which can live on hands and surfaces for 24 hours.

To reduce the risk of spreading flu you should:

- wash your hands often with warm water and soap
- use tissues to trap germs when you cough or sneeze
- bin used tissues as quickly as possible

### How to prevent flu

The flu vaccine reduces the risk of catching flu as well as spreading it to others. 

It’s more effective to get the vaccine before the start of the flu season (December to March).
