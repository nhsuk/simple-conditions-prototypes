## How to treat flu yourself

You can treat/deal with flu without going to your GP, and you should feel better in about 7 days.

[Your pharmacist can help you](#) and there are things you can do yourself at home.

To help ease flu symptoms GPs recommend:

- rest and sleep 
- keeping warm
- drinking plenty of water (or breastmilk for babies) 
- eating regular healthy meals 
- taking paracetamol and ibuprofen to help with aches and lower a temperature

Even after you’re over the flu you’ll probably feel tired for a week or so.
