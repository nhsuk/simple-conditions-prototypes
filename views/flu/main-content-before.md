::: reveal Telling the difference between cold and flu
  Cold and flu symptoms are similar but flu tends to be more severe:
  <div class="table--horizontal-scroll">
    <table class="panel panel--binary">
      <tr>
        <th>Cold</th>
        <th>Flu</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Appears gradually</td>
        <td>Appears quickly within a few hours</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Affects mainly your nose and throat</td>
        <td>Affects more than just your throat and nose</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Makes you feel unwell but you’re ok to carry on as normal - eg go to work</td>
        <td>Makes you feel exhausted and too unwell to carry on as normal</td>
      </tr>

## How to treat flu yourself

To help you get better more quickly you can:

- rest and sleep
- keep warm
- take paracetamol or ibuprofen to lower your temperature and treat aches and pains
- drink plenty of water to [avoid dehydration](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/dehydration/Pages/Introduction.aspx) (your pee should be light yellow or clear)

## Your pharmacist can help with flu 

Your pharmacist can give treatment advice and recommend flu remedies. 

Be careful not to use them if you’re taking paracetamol and ibuprofen tablets as it’s easy to take more than the recommended dose. 

Speak to your pharmacist before giving medicines to children.

### Antibiotics

GPs don’t usually recommend antibiotics for flu because they won’t relieve your symptoms or speed up your recovery.
