::: reveal Telling the difference between cold and flu
  Cold and flu symptoms are similar but flu tends to be more severe:
  Cold symptoms | Flu symptoms |
  --- | ---
  Appear gradually | Appear quickly within a few hours 
  Affect mainly your nose and throat | Affect more than just your nose and throat
  Make you feel unwell but you’re ok to carry on as normal – eg go to work | Make you feel exhausted and too unwell to carry on as normal

## Treating flu at home

To help you get better more quickly you can:

## Treating flu with medicine

To help treat aches and high a temperature you can take paracetamol and ibuprofen.

You can get medicine advice from a pharmacist. Like a GP, they can explain which flu medicines to take and explain how to take them.
