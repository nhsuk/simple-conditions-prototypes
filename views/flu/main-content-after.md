## How to avoid spreading the flu

The germs that cause flu survive on your hands and surfaces (like tables and door handles) so you should:

* wash your hands with warm water and soap regularly
* use tissues to trap germs when you cough or sneeze
* bin used tissues as quickly as possible

You’re most likely to spread the flu to other people in the first 5 days.

## How to prevent flu

The flu vaccine reduces the risk of catching flu as well as spreading it to others.

It’s best to get the vaccine before the start of the flu season (December to March).

It’s usually available September to late October.
