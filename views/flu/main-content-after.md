## How to avoid spreading the flu

The germs that cause flu survive on your hands and surfaces (like tables and door handles) so you should:

* wash your hands with warm water and soap regularly
* use tissues to trap germs when you cough or sneeze
* bin used tissues as quickly as possible

You’re most likely to spread the flu to other people in the first 5 days.

## How to prevent flu

There is a flu vaccine that reduces the risk of catching flu and spreading it to others.

Flu vaccinations are usually available during flu season - December to March.
