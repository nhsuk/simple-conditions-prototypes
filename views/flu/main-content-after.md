## How to avoid spreading the flu

You’re more likely to give the flu to other people in the first 5 days.

Flu is spread by germs from coughs and sneezes which can live on hands and surfaces for 24 hours.

To reduce the risk of spreading flu you should:

* wash your hands with warm water and soap regularly
* use tissues to trap germs when you cough or sneeze
* bin used tissues as quickly as possible

## How to prevent flu

The flu vaccine reduces the risk of catching flu as well as spreading it to others.

It’s best to get the vaccine before the start of the flu season (December to March).
