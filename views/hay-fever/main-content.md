### Treatments for hay fever from your GP

Your GP might prescribe steroids. 

If steroids and other hayfever treatments don’t work your GP may refer you for immunotherapy. This means you’ll be given small amounts of pollen as an injection or tablet to slowly build up your immunity to pollen. This kind of treatment usually starts in the winter about 3 months before the hay fever season begins.
