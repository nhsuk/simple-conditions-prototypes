## Preventing heat exhaustion and heat stroke 

There is a high risk of heat exhaustion or heat stroke during hot weather or exercise. 

To help prevent heat exhaustion or heat stroke:

- drink plenty of cold drinks, especially when exercising
- take cool baths or showers 
- wear light-colored, loose clothing 
- sprinkle water over skin or clothes 
- avoid the sun between 11am and 3pm 
- avoid excess alcohol 
- avoid extreme exercise 

This will also prevent dehydration and help your body keep itself cool. 

Keep an eye on children, the elderly and people with long-term health conditions (like diabetes or heart problems) because theyâ€™re more at risk of heat exhaustion or heat stroke.
