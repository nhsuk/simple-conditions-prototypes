## Your pharmacist can help with heat rash

To help soothe sore and itchy skin you can:

- use calamine lotion
- use hydrocortisone cream (but not on the face)
- take antihistamine tablets

You can buy these from a pharmacist without a prescription. The pharmacist can advise you on the best medicines to use, for example if you’re pregnant or a child has the rash.

## Causes of heat rash

Heat rash is caused by excessive sweating.

Sweat glands get blocked and the trapped sweat causes a rash to develop a few days later.

Babies often get it because their sweat glands aren’t fully developed.

Sweating is usually caused by hot or humid weather but other things can cause it. For example, being overweight or spending long periods in bed perhaps because of an illness.
