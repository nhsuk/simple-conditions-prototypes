There are also things you can do yourself to [help ease indigestion](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Indigestion/Pages/Introduction.aspx) and [constipation](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Constipation/Pages/Introduction.aspx)  

If you have vomiting and diarrhoea with your stomach ache, it should stop after a few days. Try to drink a lot of fluids to avoid dehydration.

Painkillers like paracetamol can help with your stomach ache but won’t stop any vomiting and diarrhoea.
