## Treating diarrhoea at home {id=adults}

Diarrhoea will go away on its own after a few days.  It’s normal to have stomach cramps and headaches.

It’s important to drink enough fluids to [avoid dehydration](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/dehydration/Pages/Introduction.aspx). Your pee should be light yellow or clear.

Drink small sips of things like water mixed with juice and soup broth to make sure you get enough salt and sugar. 

As soon as you’re able to eat things like potatoes, rice, bananas, soup, and boiled vegetables.

### Frail or elderly people with diarrhoea

Frail or elderly people can dehydrate more easily. You can get sachets at the pharmacy that contain salt, sugar and important minerals. Mix them with water to help you keep hydrated. These are called oral rehydration solutions.

### How a pharmacist can help with diarrhoea  

You can take medicines to help reduce the diarrhoea slightly and shorten it. However, you don’t have to take these and they won’t cure your diarrhoea.

Describe your symptoms to your pharmacist. They can recommend the best medicine for you.

Painkillers like paracetamol or ibuprofen can help with headaches and fevers. 

Don’t give aspirin to children under 16.

- clean the toilet after you’ve gone
- not share towels and things you put in your mouth like cutlery
- wash soiled clothes or bed linen at 60 degrees or higher
