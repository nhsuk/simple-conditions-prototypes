## How to treat piles yourself  


Piles often go away by themselves after a few days.  


To relieve any pain or discomfort when you go to the toilet:
- avoid straining when you’re on the toilet
- use moist toilet paper or baby wipes
- dab the area clean, rather than wiping it


To keep your poo soft, help you to go to the toilet regularly and stop your piles getting bigger:
- drink plenty of fluid 
- eat more fibre (fruit and vegetables, wholegrain bread, pasta and cereal)
- try to avoid drinking too much caffiene (in drinks like tea, coffee and cola)


## Your pharmacist can help with piles


To relieve swelling, itching and pain you can buy:

- creams and ointments
- suppositories (which are inserted into your bottom)

Pharmacist can give you advice about which product is best for you. Ask your pharmacist if you can speak to them in a private area if you’re embarrassed. 

You shouldn’t use piles medicines for longer than a week as they can irritate your skin. Don’t use more than one product at the same time.
