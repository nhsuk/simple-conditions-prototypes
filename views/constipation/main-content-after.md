Constipation in adults has many possible causes. Sometimes there is no obvious reason. 

The most common causes include:

- not eating enough fibre - such as fruit, vegetables and cereals
- not drinking enough fluids
- not exercising or being less active
- often ignoring the urge to go to the toilet
- changing your diet or daily routine
- stress, anxiety or depression

If you are taking any medication, check the side effects. Constipation is a common side effect.

## Pregnancy

Pregnancy is a common cause of constipation, especially during the early stages. 

This is because a hormone called progesterone is produced more during pregnancy. This make it difficult for the bowel muscles to work properly.

There is also a higher risk of constipation for 6 weeks after having a baby. This is known as the postpartum stage.

## How you can treat constipation yourself{id=treating_adults}

It’s usually possible to treat constipation at home with some simple changes to your diet and lifestyle. If you’re pregnant, it’s still safe to try these measures first.

You may notice a difference within a few days. Sometimes it takes a few weeks before your symptoms improve.

### Diet

Drink plenty of fluids to avoid [dehydration](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/dehydration/Pages/Introduction.aspx). Avoid alcohol while you’re constipated.

Try to increase the fibre in your diet by eating at least five portions of fresh fruit and vegetables a day. Other high-fibre foods will also help, such as:

- wholegrain breakfast cereal
- wholemeal bread
- wholegrain pasta
- brown rice

Adding some wheat bran to your diet will also help to make your stools softer and easier to pass.

- [what counts towards your five a day](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/5ADAY/Pages/Whatcounts.aspx)

### Exercise

Try to increase your activity or the amount of exercise you do. A daily walk or run can help you to poo more regularly.

- [getting active with a disability or long-term condition](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/fitness/Pages/get-active-with-a-disability-or-a-long-term-condition.aspx)
- [exercise during pregnancy](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/pages/pregnancy-exercise.aspx)

### Toilet routine

Give yourself plenty of time to go to the toilet while you’re constipated. Try to keep to a routine and don’t delay using the toilet if you feel the urge to poo.

Try resting your feet on a low stool while going to the toilet, so your knees are above your hips. This can make passing stools easier.

### Medication

If your constipation is caused by medication, it should ease once you have finished taking it.

Speak to your doctor before you stop taking any prescribed medication.

## Babies and toddlers: treating constipation{id=treating_babies}

It’s usually possible to treat your baby or toddler at home with some simple changes to their diet and a positive toilet routine.

You may notice a difference within a few days. Sometimes it takes a few weeks before their symptoms improve.

### Diet

If your baby is constipated but hasn't started to eat solid foods, give them extra water between their normal feeds. If you’re using formula milk, don’t add more water to the mixture.

You may want to try gently moving your baby's legs in a bicycling motion or carefully massaging their tummy to help stimulate their bowels.

If your baby is constipated and eating solid foods, give them plenty of fluids. Encourage them to eat fruit and chop or puree if it’s easier for them to eat. It’s important not to force your child to eat so they aren’t stressed.

The best fruits for constipation include apples, grapes, pears and strawberries.

Read more about what to feed young children(http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/Pages/understanding-food-groups.aspx#fruit).

### Toilet routine

Some children feel anxious or stressed about using the toilet. This can cause them to hold in their poo and lead to constipation.

This usually happens during potty training or if their usual toilet routine has changed. For example, after moving house or starting nursery.

It’s important to give your child plenty of time to use the toilet and avoid making them feel stressed or under pressure. Try not to be angry while they are still learning.

It may help to encourage your child when they use the toilet to create a positive toilet routine. Some parents find a reward chart works.

## Your pharmacist can help with constipation {id=pharmacist}

Speak to your pharmacist if diet and lifestyle changes aren’t helping. They can suggest a suitable laxative. These are medicines which help you poo more regularly.

Most laxatives work within two to three days but some work within 6 to 12 hours. They should only be used for a short period of time.

Laxatives are not recommended for children unless they are prescribed by your GP.
