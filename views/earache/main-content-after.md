## Spotting earache in babies and young children

A young child might have earache if they:

- rub or pull their ear
- don’t react to some sounds
- have a fever
- are irritable or restless
- are off their food
- keep losing their balance

## How long it lasts 

How long it lasts depends on what’s causing it.  Most earaches in children are caused by an ear infection, and they usually start to feel better after a few days.
