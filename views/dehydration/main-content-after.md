## How to prevent dehydration

It’s important to drink plenty of fluids regularly. 

Your pee should be a pale or clear colour. 

Drink when you feel thirsty or when there’s a higher risk of dehydrating. For example, if you’re vomiting, sweating or you have diarrhoea. 

It’s also important to drink enough if you have [diabetes](https://beta.nhs.uk/conditions/type-2-diabetes/check-if-you-have-it) or alcoholism.

### Carers: making sure someone drinks enough

Sometimes people you care for don’t have a sense of how much they’re drinking.

To help them: 

- make sure they drink during meal times
- make drinking a social thing like ‘having a cup of tea’
- offer them food with a high water content - for example, soups, ice cream, jellies or fruits like melon

- fewer or no tears when they cry
- a sunken soft spot (fontanelle) on their head
- dark yellow urine - ? can you tell in a nappy
