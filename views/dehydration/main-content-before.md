## How you can treat dehydration yourself

Drink water when you feel any dehydration symptoms. Keep taking small sips until you feel better. 

When you’re dehydrated your body also loses salt and sugar. To help restore sugar and salt levels you can drink: 

- water
- fruit juice or squash mixed with water
- salty things like soup 

## Your pharmacist can help with dehydration

You can buy special sachets from a pharmacy. They’re called oral rehydration solutions and you mix them with water. They contain salt, sugar and minerals that your body loses when you’re not drinking enough.
