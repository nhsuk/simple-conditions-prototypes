## Check if you’re dehydrated

Symptoms of dehydration are/include: 

- feeling thirsty
- dark yellow and strong smelling pee 
- feeling dizzy or lightheaded 
- feeling tired
- dry mouth, lips, eyes
- peeing little and less than 3 to 4 times a day

## How you can treat dehydration yourself

Drink water when you feel any dehydration symptoms. Keep taking small sips until you feel better. 

When you’re dehydrated your body also loses salt and sugar. To help restore sugar and salt levels you can drink: 

- water
- fruit juice or squash mixed with water
- salty things like soup 

## Your pharmacist can help with dehydration

You can buy special sachets from a pharmacy. They’re called oral rehydration solutions and you mix them with water. They contain salt, sugar and minerals that your body loses when you’re not drinking enough.

## How to prevent dehydration

It’s important to drink plenty of fluids regularly. 

Your pee should be a pale or clear colour. 

Drink when you feel thirsty or when there’s a higher risk of dehydrating. For example, if you’re vomiting, sweating or you have diarrhoea. 

It’s also important to drink enough if you have [diabetes](https://beta.nhs.uk/conditions/type-2-diabetes/check-if-you-have-it) or alcoholism.

### Carers: making sure someone drinks enough

Sometimes people you care for don’t have a sense of how much they’re drinking.

To help them: 

- make sure they drink during meal times
- make drinking a social thing like ‘having a cup of tea’
- offer them food with a high water content - for example, soups, ice cream, jellies or fruits like melon
