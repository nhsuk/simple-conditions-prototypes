## Treating mouth ulcers at home

Mouth ulcers need time to heal and there’s no quick fix. Avoid things that irritate your mouth ulcer to help:

- speed up the healing process 
- reduce pain
- prevent it returning


A saltwater mouthwash may help to soothe the pain. Dissolve half a teaspoon of table salt in a glass of warm water and rinse your mouth out, but don’t swallow it.

## How your pharmacist can help

Your pharmacist may suggest a treatment to speed up healing, prevent infection or reduce pain, such as:

- antimicrobial mouthwash
- a paste to protect the ulcer
- a painkilling mouthwash, gel or spray
- corticosteroid lozenges

These can be bought without a prescription but don’t always work.

!!! attention
  ## See a dentist or GP if your mouth ulcer:
  - lasts longer than three weeks
  - keeps coming back
  - becomes more painful and red - this may be a sign of infection
!!!

Although most mouth ulcers are harmless, a long-lasting mouth ulcer is sometimes a sign of mouth cancer. It’s best to get it checked.

### Treatment from a dentist or GP

A dentist or GP may prescribe treatment for severe, recurrent or infected mouth ulcers, such as:

- painkillers
- antibiotics
- strong corticosteroids
