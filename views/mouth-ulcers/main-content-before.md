## Treating mouth ulcers at home

Mouth ulcers need time to heal and there’s no quick fix. Avoiding things that irritate your mouth ulcer can:

- help to speed up the healing process 
- reduce pain
- help to prevent them returning

### Do:

- use a soft-bristled toothbrush
- drink cool drinks through a straw
- stick to softer foods - such as milk, yoghurt and mashed potato
- get regular dental check-ups
- eat a healthy, balanced diet
{.list--check}

### Don’t:

- eat very spicy, salty or acidic food - such as curries, salted peanuts or citrus fruits
- eat hard, crunchy food - such as toast, crisps or sweets
- drink very hot or acidic drinks - such as coffee, fruit juice or fizzy drinks
- use chewing gum
- use toothpaste containing sodium lauryl sulphate

A saltwater mouthwash can help to soothe pain and prevent infection. Dissolve half a teaspoon of table salt in a glass of warm water and rinse your mouth out regularly, but don’t swallow it.

  If you’re still in pain, [speak to your pharmacist](#).
!!!

They may suggest:

- antimicrobial mouthwash to speed up healing and prevent infection
- a paste to protect the ulcer while it heals
- a painkilling mouthwash, gel or spray
- corticosteroid lozenges to reduce pain and speed up healing

These can be bought without a prescription but don’t always work.

!!! attention
  ## See a dentist or GP if your mouth ulcer:
  - lasts longer than three weeks
  - keeps coming back
  - becomes more painful and red - this may be a sign of a bacterial infection, particularly if you also have a fever
  - is bleeding
!!!

They may prescribe antibiotics for infection, painkillers or a course of stronger corticosteroids.


Although most mouth ulcers are harmless, a long-lasting mouth ulcer is sometimes a sign of mouth cancer. This is more likely if you’re a heavy smoker, drinker or have HPV infection.

Mouth ulcers usually appear inside the mouth on the cheeks, tongue or lips. It’s possible to have more than one ulcer at a time and they may shrink, grow or spread.

They shouldn't be confused with [cold sores](#), which appear on the outside of the lips or around the mouth.

If you have several mouth ulcers, this can be a symptom of:

- [hand, foot and mouth disease](#) - which also causes a rash on the hands and feet and is more common in children under 10
- oral [lichen planus](#) - which also causes a white, lacy pattern inside the cheeks

## You can’t always prevent mouth ulcers

Most single mouth ulcers are caused by things you can try to avoid, such as:

- biting the inside of your cheek
- badly-fitting dentures, braces, fillings or a sharp tooth
- cuts or burns from food and drink
- a food allergy
- damaging your gums with a toothbrush or irritating toothpaste
- feeling very tired, stressed or anxious

Sometime they’re triggered by things you can’t always control, such as:

- hormonal changes - such as during pregnancy
- your genes - some families get mouth ulcers more often
- a long-term condition - such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), coeliac disease or Behçet's disease
- a vitamin B12 or iron deficiency
- medications - including some NSAIDs, beta-blockers or nicorandil
- stopping smoking – many people develop temporary mouth ulcers when they first stop smoking
