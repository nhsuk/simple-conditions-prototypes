## Your pharmacist can help with mouth ulcers

Your pharmacist may suggest a treatment to speed up healing, prevent infection or reduce pain, such as:

- antimicrobial mouthwash 
- a painkilling mouthwash, gel or spray
- corticosteroid lozenges

These can be bought without a prescription but may not always work.

!!! attention
  ## See a dentist or GP if:
  Your mouth ulcer:

  - lasts longer than three weeks
  - keeps coming back
  - becomes more painful and red - this may be a sign of an infection
!!!

Your GP or dentist may prescribe stronger medication to treat severe, recurrent or infected mouth ulcers.

Although most mouth ulcers are harmless, a long-lasting mouth ulcer is sometimes a sign of mouth cancer. It’s best to get it checked.
