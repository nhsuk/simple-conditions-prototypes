## Treating mouth ulcers at home

Mouth ulcers need time to heal and there’s no quick fix. Avoid things that irritate your mouth ulcer to help:

- speed up the healing process 
- reduce pain
- prevent it returning

A saltwater mouthwash may help to soothe the pain. Dissolve half a teaspoon of table salt in a glass of warm water and rinse your mouth out, but don’t swallow it.

### Do:

- use a soft-bristled toothbrush
- drink cool drinks through a straw
- stick to softer foods
- get regular dental check-ups
- eat a healthy, balanced diet

### Don’t:

- eat very spicy, salty or acidic food
- eat rough, crunchy food - such as toast or crisps
- drink very hot or acidic drinks - such as fruit juice
- use chewing gum
- use toothpaste containing sodium lauryl sulphate

## How your pharmacist can help

Your pharmacist may suggest a treatment to speed up healing, prevent infection or reduce pain, such as:

- antimicrobial mouthwash
- a paste to protect the ulcer
- a painkilling mouthwash, gel or spray
- corticosteroid lozenges

These can be bought without a prescription but don’t always work.

  ## See a dentist or GP if your mouth ulcer:
  - lasts longer than three weeks
  - keeps coming back
  - becomes more painful and red - this may be a sign of infection

  Although most mouth ulcers are harmless, a long-lasting mouth ulcer is sometimes a sign of mouth cancer. It’s best to get it checked.
