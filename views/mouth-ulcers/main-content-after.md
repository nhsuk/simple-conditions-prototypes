Mouth ulcers aren’t contagious. They shouldn't be confused with [cold sores](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Cold-sore/Pages/Introduction.aspx), which appear on the outside of the lips or around the mouth.

If you have several mouth ulcers, this can be a symptom of:

- [hand, foot and mouth disease](#) - which also causes a rash on the hands and feet and is more common in children under 10
- oral [lichen planus](#) - which also causes a white, lacy pattern inside the cheeks

## You can’t always prevent mouth ulcers

Most single mouth ulcers are caused by things you can try to avoid, such as:

- biting the inside of your cheek
- badly-fitting dentures, braces, fillings or a sharp tooth
- cuts or burns from food and drink
- a food intolerance or allergy
- damaging your gums with a toothbrush or irritating toothpaste
- feeling very tired, stressed or anxious

Sometime they’re triggered by things you can’t always control, such as:

- hormonal changes - such as during pregnancy
- your genes - some families get mouth ulcers more often
- a long-term condition - such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), coeliac disease or Behçet's disease
- a vitamin B12 or iron deficiency
- medications - including some NSAIDs, beta-blockers or nicorandil
- stopping smoking – many people develop temporary mouth ulcers when they first stop smoking
