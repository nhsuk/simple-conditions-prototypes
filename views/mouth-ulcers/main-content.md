## How you can treat mouth ulcers yourself

Mouth ulcers need time to heal and there’s no quick fix. Avoiding things that irritate your mouth ulcer should help:

- speed up the healing process 
- reduce pain
- reduce the chance of it returning

## Your pharmacist can help with mouth ulcers

Your pharmacist may suggest a treatment to speed up healing, prevent infection or reduce pain, such as:

- antimicrobial mouthwash 
- a painkilling mouthwash, gel or spray
- corticosteroid lozenges

These can be bought without a prescription but may not always work.

!!! attention
  ## See a dentist or GP if:
  Your mouth ulcer:

  - lasts longer than three weeks
  - keeps coming back
  - becomes more painful and red - this may be a sign of an infection
!!!

Your GP or dentist may prescribe stronger medication to treat severe, recurrent or infected mouth ulcers.

Although most mouth ulcers are harmless, a long-lasting mouth ulcer is sometimes a sign of mouth cancer. It’s best to get it checked.

Mouth ulcers aren’t contagious and they shouldn't be confused with [cold sores](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Cold-sore/Pages/Introduction.aspx). Cold sores appear on the lips or around the mouth and often begin with a tingling, itching or burning sensation.

If you have several mouth ulcers, this can be a symptom of:

- [hand, foot and mouth disease](https://beta.nhs.uk/conditions/hand-foot-and-mouth-disease) - which also causes a rash on the hands and feet
- oral lichen planus - which causes a white, lacy pattern inside the cheeks

## You can’t always prevent mouth ulcers

Most single mouth ulcers are caused by things you can try to avoid, such as:

- biting the inside of your cheek
- badly-fitting dentures, braces, rough fillings or a sharp tooth
- cuts or burns while eating or drinking - for example, hard food or hot drinks
- a food intolerance or allergy
- damaging your gums with a toothbrush or irritating toothpaste
- feeling tired, stressed or anxious

Sometime they’re triggered by things you can’t always control, such as:

- hormonal changes - such as during pregnancy
- your genes - some families get mouth ulcers more often
- a long-term condition - such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), coeliac disease or Behçet's disease
- a vitamin B12 or iron deficiency
- medications - including some NSAIDs, beta-blockers or nicorandil
- stopping smoking – people may develop mouth ulcers when they first stop smoking
