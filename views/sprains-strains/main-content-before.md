## How to treat sprains and strains yourself

For the first couple of days follow the 4 steps known as RICE therapy to help bring down swelling and protect and support the injury:

1. **Rest** - try not to put weight on it and stop any exercise or activities  
1. **Ice** - apply an ice pack or a bag of frozen food wrapped in a teatowel to the injury. Do this for up to 20 minutes every 2-3 hours. 
1. **Compression** - wrap a bandage around the injury to support it 
1. **Elevate** - as much as possible keep it raised on a pillow

To help prevent swelling, try to avoid heat, such as hot baths and heat packs, alcohol and getting massages for the first couple of days.

When you can move the injured area without pain stopping you, try to keep moving it so the joint or muscle doesn’t become stiff.

## How to prevent strains

Sprains and strains happen when you overstretch or twist a muscle. Not warming up before exercising, tired muscles and playing sport are common causes.

## Your pharmacy can help  

To help ease any pain use over-the-counter painkillers such as paracetamol or NSAID  (non-steroidal anti inflammatory drug) cream or gel such as ibuprofen. You can buy these from pharmacies or supermarkets. 

To bring down swelling use NSAID tablets.Take them 48 hours after your injury because they can delay healing if taken too soon. Talk to your pharmacist if you would like to take them earlier.
