## How to treat sprains and strains at home

For the first couple of days follow the 4 steps known as RICE therapy to help bring down swelling and protect and support the injury:

1. **Rest** - try not to put weight on it and stop any exercise or activities 
1. **Ice** - apply an ice pack or a bag of frozen food wrapped in a teatowel to the injury. Do this for up to 20 minutes every 2-3 hours.  
1. **Compression** - wrap a bandage around the injury to support it
1. **Elevate** - as much as possible keep it raised on a pillow 

To help avoid swelling, avoid heat, such as hot baths and heat packs, alcohol and getting massages for the first couple of days.

After the first couple of days, when you can move the injured area without pain stopping you, try to keep moving it to avoid the joint or muscle becoming stiff.

### Pain relief

To help ease any pain use over-the-counter painkillers such as paracetamol or NSAID  (non-steroidal anti inflammatory drug) cream or gel such as ibuprofen. You can buy these from pharmacies or supermarkets. 

NSAID tablets can also help to reduce swelling. Take them 48 hours after your injury because that can delay healing if taken too soon. Talk to your pharmacist if you would like to take them earlier or use a stronger painkiller.

## How long will it take to heal?

- After two weeks: most sprains and strains will feel better. 
- Between 6-8 weeks: Avoid exercise as there’s a risk of further damage. 

More severe sprains and strains can take several months to get back to normal.
