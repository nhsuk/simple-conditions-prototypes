## What if itâ€™s a broken bone?

It can be a broken bone if:

- you heard a crack when you had your injury
- the pain is severe 
- the injured body part has changed shape
- you feel dizzy or sick
<hr>

If you think you have broken a bone, you should go to a [minor injuries unit](http://www.nhs.uk/service-search/Minor-injuries-unit/LocationSearch/551) or [A&E](http://www.nhs.uk/Service-Search/Accident-and-emergency-services/LocationSearch/428) as you may need an X-ray.
