Sprains and strains happen when you overstretch or twist a muscle.  This is often due to playing sport or doing exercise. They are common in the ankles and knees. 

## How to treat sprains and strains at home

You can treat most sprains or strains at home.  Follow 4 steps known as RICE therapy:

1. **Rest** - stop exercise or activities and try not to put weight on the injury for 48 hours 
1. **Compression** - use an elastic bandage to limit swelling and protect the injury
1. **Ice** - apply an ice pack or a bag of vegetables wrapped in a teatowel. Do this for up to 20 minutes every 2-3 hours  
1. **Elevate** - as much as possible keep the injury raised on a pillow to reduce swelling 

You should avoid heat, such as hot baths and heat packs, alcohol and massage for the first couple of days as these can cause swelling and slow healing.

### Use medicine for pain

Take painkillers such as paracetamol if you have pain.  You can also use NSAID  (non-steroidal anti inflammatory drug) cream or gel. You can buy these from pharmacies or supermarkets. 

NSAID tablets can help to reduce swelling.  Take them 48hrs after your injury because that can delay healing if taken too soon.

## How long will it take to heal?

2 weeks: most sprains and strains will feel better. 
6-8 weeks: Avoid exercise as there’s a risk of further damage. 

More severe sprains and strains can take several months to get back to normal.

  ## See a GP if:
  - the injury isn’t feeling any better within a few days
  - you’re in pain and can’t put weight on the injured joint
